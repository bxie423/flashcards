Flashcards, by Bernard Xie

This is a simple flashcard program that allows the flashcard stack to be saved to a file.  This file simply consists of a key-value pair, separated by any number of tabs.  Only the values before the first tab and after the last tab will be read.  Any line beginning with a '#' will be ignored.

I recommend running this program in a full-screen window.  As of right now, the formatting will only allow items of 60 characters, and answers of 120 characters.  A later revision might add dynamically-sized spacing.
